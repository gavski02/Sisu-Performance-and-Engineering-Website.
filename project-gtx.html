                <h1>The GTX That Started It All: A RallyCross Journey</h1>
                <p class="meta"><em>Posted: May 2, 2025</em></p>

                <h2>The Acquisition: Double Trouble in Ohio</h2>
                {/* --- Full text restored below --- */}
                <p>The story of our red Mazda 323 GTX begins back in March 2022. At the time, I was living in Lima, Ohio, deep in my studies for High Performance Automotive at the University of Northwestern Ohio (UNOH). My interest in the 323 GTX stemmed from a couple of places. Firstly, its often-underappreciated rally pedigree fascinated me. As a Group A homologation special, the little AWD turbocharged hatchback battled valiantly in the World Rally Championship, even securing a few WRC victories in the late 80s. It was a giant killer in its day. Secondly, I've always had a soft spot for Mazdas, having owned multiple RX-7s and other rotary-powered vehicles over the years.</p>
                <p>So, when a pair of non-running, fairly rusty GTXs popped up for sale in Indianapolis, I had to check them out. One was red, the other white. The drive was made, a deal was struck, and suddenly I was the proud owner of two project cars.</p>

                <img loading="lazy" src="assets/red_gtx_blog/Both Red and White Car after pickup.webp" alt="The red and white Mazda 323 GTXs shortly after acquisition in Indianapolis">

                <p>The white car was in pretty rough shape, missing a lot of parts and with significant rust. It quickly became clear it would serve as a parts donor for the red one. Eventually, after picking it clean, the shell was sold off.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="assets/red_gtx_blog/White GTX on Trailer.webp" alt="The white 323 GTX parts car on a trailer">

                <p>The red car, while also non-running, was a more promising candidate. For a Midwest car, the rust was surprisingly limited, though not non-existent. One immediate quirk was the fuel system – the original gas tank had rotted out (a common issue), and someone had crudely fitted a small fuel cell into the spare tire well. This janky setup, while functional, was a ticking time bomb that would cause headaches later.</p>

                <h2>Ignition: Bringing the Red GTX to Life</h2>
                <p>Getting the red GTX running turned out to be surprisingly straightforward. After some troubleshooting, I discovered a bunch of broken wires leading to the Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor. A bit of wiring repair, some fresh fluids, and the B6T engine sputtered back to life.</p>
                 <img loading="lazy" src="assets/red_gtx_blog/Broken Wire.webp" alt="Broken MAF sensor wiring found on the red 323 GTX">

                <p>Digging through the parts from the white car yielded a gem: an ECU fitted with a "Rocket chip" – a popular period modification. I swapped this into the red car. To add a little spice (and because I was a broke college student), I installed a $10 manual boost controller and cranked the boost up to around 14 psi. </p>

                <h2>Daily Duties and a Painful Starter</h2>
                <p>Suddenly, the little GTX was a ton of fun! It became my daily driver for about a year. It was surprisingly reliable in this mildly tuned state. Of course, there were minor hiccups. The starter decided to give up one day, and I quickly learned just how much of a pain replacing it is on these cars – it's buried deep under the intake manifold. But aside from that, and regular fluid changes, it was a great, characterful daily.</p>

                <h2>RallyCross Debut: The West Virginia Incident</h2>
                <p>By October 2023, I was eager to test the car's rally heritage. I found an SCCA RallyCross event down in West Virginia and decided to make the 6-hour trek. Coincidentally, another GTX owner was there – a rare sight! Unfortunately, I watched him dramatically lunch his center differential on his first run. Lesson learned: never, ever launch a GTX hard, especially on tarmac.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="assets/red_gtx_blog/Gtx at west virginia rally cross.webp" alt="The red 323 GTX competing at the West Virginia RallyCross event">
                <p>My first run went well initially, but towards the end, the engine started cutting out intermittently under load. I didn't think much of it, maybe just some old car gremlins. On the second run, however, the cutting was severe. The car could barely build boost and struggled to accelerate. Unsure of the cause and not wanting to risk major damage, I decided to call it a day and limp the car the 6 hours home. Strangely, once on the steady-state cruise of the highway, it ran perfectly fine.</p>


                <h2>Déjà Vu: The Detroit Disaster and the Long Limp Home</h2>
                <p>Being young and perhaps a bit naive, I figured the cutting issue was a fluke. A month or two later (around Nov/Dec 2023), I signed up for another RallyCross event, this time closer to home with the Detroit SCCA region. The car drove perfectly for the couple of hours to the event site.</p>
                <p>Then, about 20 seconds into my very first run: CUTTING. Hard. Frustrated, I tried diagnosing it at the event, checking connections and looking for obvious issues, but found nothing. Cutting my losses, I decided to drive home and figure it out properly this time. The highway drive home was *not* fine this time. The car would hit a hard fuel cut anytime I tried to exceed about 40 mph. It was a long, slow, frustrating journey that took double the expected time, but hey, it was an adventure, right?</p>

                <h2>The Culprit Revealed: Pesky Fuel Foam</h2>
                <p>Back in the garage, I decided to start with the basics and give the fuel system a thorough inspection, especially given the janky fuel cell setup. When I disconnected one of the fuel lines, I was met with a nasty surprise: disintegrated fuel tank foam. The cheap foam inside the old fuel cell had broken down over time and was clogging the fuel lines and likely the filter, causing fuel starvation under high load. It took a long, meticulous cleaning process to get every last bit of foam out of the lines, pump, and injectors, but once done, the cutting issue was completely gone.</p>

                <h2>Winter Warrior: Sno*Drift Bound</h2>
                 <p>With the fuel issue sorted, the GTX was reliable again. In February 2024, I drove it up to Northern Michigan for the Sno*Drift Rally, where I volunteered. The trip was epic, putting the little AWD car to the test in extreme snow and ice conditions, and it handled it brilliantly. It was a great confidence booster.</p>

                <h2>Go West, Young Mazda: The Move to Bend</h2>
                <p>Shortly after Sno*Drift, I finished my program at UNOH and decided to move back to my roots on the West Coast, specifically to Bend, Oregon. The trusty red GTX, of course, made the journey with me.</p>

                <h2>Phase 2 & 3: Getting Serious in the PNW</h2>
                 <p>Now in Bend, with access to a proper shop space and other vehicles to drive (including my 13B-swapped Mazda GLC), I wasn't afraid to start modifying the GTX more seriously. The first major step was upgrading the turbo to a VJ20, the larger unit found on JDM GTX/GTR models. While arguably oversized for the stock B6T, it was fun running around 20 psi through it.</p>
                 <p>Alongside the turbo, I addressed the fuel system properly, installing a new, safer fuel cell housed within a protective cage, along with upgraded lines and pump. This setup debuted during the Northwest Rally Association's Winter RallyCross series at DirtFish towards the end of 2024 and into early 2025.</p>
                 {/* --- Removed Dirtfish image here --- */}
                 <p>Unfortunately, my fun with the VJ20 was short-lived – I ended up blowing the turbo while messing around in the snow before the final event of the series.</p>
                 <img loading="lazy" src="assets/red_gtx_blog/Snapped VJ20 Turbo.webp" alt="The failed VJ20 turbocharger shaft">

                 <p>This setback was the catalyst for the next, much bigger phase. I decided it was time to go all-in. Over the next year or so, the car underwent a major transformation:</p>

                 <img loading="lazy" src="assets/red_gtx_blog/Test fitting the Manifold with a full size radiator I later moved away from.webp" alt="Test fitting the new manifold and a large radiator">

                 <ul>
                     <li><strong>Custom Turbo Setup:</strong> I designed and fabricated my own exhaust manifold to suit a modern, upgraded ball-bearing turbocharger.</li>
                     <li><strong>Engine Management:</strong> A Haltech Elite 1500 ECU was wired in, offering vastly superior control and tuning capabilities.</li>
                     <li><strong>Supporting Mods:</strong> A custom water-to-air intercooler setup was built, a full 3-inch exhaust system fabricated, and fresh-air anti-lag configured on the Haltech. Custom rear lateral links were also fabricated.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <img loading="lazy" src="assets/red_gtx_blog/Progress on new setup fab.webp" alt="Progress fabricating the new turbo setup components">

                 <p>This comprehensive overhaul took the better part of a year, involving countless hours of design, fabrication, wiring, and tuning.</p>

                <h2>The Rebirth and Recent Battles (2025)</h2>
                <p>Finally, the extensively modified GTX was back, running better and faster than ever before. We debuted the new setup on March 15th, 2025, at a rallycross event in Lind, Washington. The car performed flawlessly, proving the potential of the new combination. It was incredibly rewarding after the long build process.</p>

                 {/* Lind image placeholder removed previously */}

                 <p>Next up was an event in Spokane, Washington, on April 26th. This event featured a tricky mixed surface course, with a very bumpy and dusty dirt section. Unfortunately, our luck ran out – halfway through the day, we lost the new ball-bearing turbo.</p>

                <h2>Back to the Drawing Board (Summer 2025)</h2>
                <p>So, here we are, back in the shop as of May 2nd, 2025. The recent turbo failure, while frustrating, has provided valuable data. I've learned a lot over the past year about what works and what doesn't on this platform under demanding conditions. Some of the solutions I implemented previously weren't optimal and can be massively improved.</p>
                <p>My goal for this summer is a full redesign of the turbo and supporting systems, focusing on reliability and efficiency to be more competitive in future events. The journey with this little red GTX continues, and we're excited to push its development even further. Stay tuned!</p>
